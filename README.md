# Multitask-Representation-Learning-with-Temporal-Attention-for-Zero-Shot-Time-Series-AD
Source code of the research paper "Multitask Representation Learning with Temporal Attention for Zero-Shot Time Series Anomaly Detection"

We propose a multi-task LSTM autoencoder with temporal attention mechanism (MTL-LATAM) framework for timeseries anomaly detection
