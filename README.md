# Multitask-Representation-Learning-with-Temporal-Attention-for-Zero-Shot-Time-Series-AD
Source code of the research paper "Multitask Representation Learning with Temporal Attention for Zero-Shot Time Series Anomaly Detection"

# Method
We propose a multi-task LSTM autoencoder with temporal attention mechanism (MTL-LATAM) framework for timeseries anomaly detection.

# Datasets
Ex√ºerimental evaluation is performed on two datasets: a real-world photovoltaic inverter dataset and on an oepn-source Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark (SKAB) dataset https://github.com/waico/SKAB
